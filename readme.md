In this project, I created temperature forecast for Berlin-Tempelhof.
First,I extracted and cleaned temperature data from www.ecad.eu
After plotting and inspecting the different components of a time series, I built a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality.
Then I modeled time dependence of the remainder using an AR model and tested the remainder for stationarity.
Lastly, I included ARIMA and SARIMAX models and compared the statistical output of different AR models.
In the end, I created Choropleth map with aminated future forecast unsing the Geaojason file of Berlin's districts.
